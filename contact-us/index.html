					If you live in the Lake Almanor area, we meet for the Lord’s Supper every Sunday. We meet in different homes at different times, so please call.

					Certainly the church that Jesus was promising to make was not an afterthought either. He must have had it all worked out, because He is God and does things that way.
				</p>

					We might not always get that, because we don’t start in perfection. Wilbur and Orville Wright would be astounded at the jet planes today, not even imagining things like computer assisted flying, advanced materials, and GPS positioning. But they were just humans. Nicolaus Copernicus would stand speechless to know astronomy calculates the positions of all the moons of the different planets in our solar system to the seconds [I am including Pluto in that, I am not giving up on her as a planet just by someone’s say so.] More than technology, the Lascaux artist would be impressed with cubism, realism, impressionism and the different medias of oil, water color, pastel and others. But what about spiritual things? Would Jesus be impressed with the current state of humanity’s spirituality? I would venture not as enthusiastic as Wilbur and Orville in flight, a tad bit unimpressed unlike Copernicus in astronomy, and not seeing much current beauty as the Lascaux artist. Why? Why does even the church struggle to model Jesus?
				</p>
				<p>
					That question is what has driven us to find the answer. This is our answer: get back to the original church that Jesus intended, planned, and made in the 1st century that we can read about in the Bible. He did not need to improve it, for He perfected it in the beginning. He did not need to grow with society, for society is directed by sin. We are striving to remove the additions and subtractions that culture, society, ages, and norms have used in misdirecting us from the original intent of Jesus making His church. We are striving to discover and live as the original church of Jesus Christ.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have the love of Christ to see Him shine, the faith to do things by His will, and the hope that He can build His church...
