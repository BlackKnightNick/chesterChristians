					If you live in the Lake Almanor area, we meet for the Lord’s Supper every Sunday. We meet in different homes at different times, so please call.
				</h2>
				<h1>
					But if you want to get serious and know the Lord:
				</h1>
				<p>
					We will study with you privately in your home or ours. Call Charles at <a href="tel:3606200586">(360) 620-0586</a>, he is one of our roving evangelists.
				</p>
				<p>
					Quiere una clase en español. No hay problema. Dane se habla poco y tiene clases en español. ¡Qué bueno!
				</p>
				<p>
					We study the Old Testament on Sundays. Classes for all ages. This week: <a class="content-book">Genesis</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					We study the New Testament during the week. Classes for all ages. This week: <a class="content-book">Revelation</a>
				</p>
				<h1>Weddings & Funerals</h1>
				<p>
					We have evangelists who would be more than willing to help you with you wedding, but we don't have a building. You get the building or the place and we'll help you on your special day. One of them has skydived before too, if that is your need.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are looking for help for funerals, our evangelists can help you there too. Sorry for your loss, let us know what we can do.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our preachers are not that good at Bar Mitzvahs, because they're Christian. But call anyway!
				</p>
				<p>
					We have supported evangelists to provide these services for free.
